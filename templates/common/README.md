# Basic [VKUI](https://github.com/VKCOM/VKUI) app

## Scripts

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

#### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed.
